# A intercepting Proxy in Rust

rust in the middle -> ritm -> "Rhythm"

## Why?
Java Proxys eat your RAM and look ugly while doing it.

Also, ZAP messes up base64 decoding and is not able to alter all the filds in a HTTP request (like the Host).
Furthermore, Burp and esspecially ZAP could use some proxychains style proxy support.

## build

1. https://docs.rs/openssl/latest/openssl/#building
2. https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/
3. `cargo build -p rhythm_prx`
4. `cd rhythm_ui`
5. `wasm-pack build --target web`
6. `cd ..`
7. `cp rhythm_ui/pkg/rhythm_ui.js main.js`
8. `cp rhythm_ui/pkg/rhythm_ui_bg.wasm main.wasm`
9. `cat rhythm_ui/assets/{code,ctx_men,ilist,misc,switch,tabs,tree}.css > style.css`
10. `cp rhythm_ui/assets/index.html index.html`
