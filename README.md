# A intercepting Proxy in Rust

rust in the middle -> ritm -> "Rhythm"

## Why?
Java Proxys eat your RAM and look ugly while doing it.

Also, ZAP messes up base64 decoding and is not able to alter all the filds in a HTTP request (like the Host).
Furthermore, Burp and esspecially ZAP could use some proxychains style proxy support.
